Rating System

This project is a simple web-based application developed using Java in Apache NetBeans.
It allows users to rate and review different food items, view average ratings, and explore various dishes.
The system consists of both client-side and server-side components, providing interaction between users and the server for data handling.
It helps in understanding web development concepts such as JSP, Servlets, and dynamic content generation.
